# üì¶ Microservices Architecture Example

## üõ† Overview

This repository demonstrates a microservices architecture composed of the following components:

- **Client**: Front-end or external system interacting with the backend services.
- **Auth Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization, utilizing **PostgreSQL** for data storage.
- **Tracking Service**: Handles event tracking and monitoring, storing data in **MongoDB**.
- **Message Broker**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between services, ensuring reliable message delivery.

### Components:

1. **Client**:
   - Interacts with the `Auth Service` for authentication and data requests.
   - Receives data and updates in response to user actions.

2. **Auth Service**:
   - Handles:
     - User registration and login.
     - Token generation (e.g., JWT for secure communication).
   - Stores user data securely in **PostgreSQL**.

3. **Tracking Service**:
   - Consumes events sent by the `Auth Service` via the `Message Broker`.
   - Persists tracking data in **MongoDB** for analytics and monitoring.

4. **Message Broker**:
   - Acts as a communication layer between services (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka).
   - Ensures reliable message delivery and decouples service dependencies.

## üñ• Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.12
- **Framework**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for building REST APIs.
- **Databases**:
  - **PostgreSQL**: User data storage for the `Auth Service`.
  - **MongoDB**: Event and tracking data storage for the `Tracking Service`.
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for asynchronous communication.
- **Containerization**: Docker for packaging and deployment.
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose (optionally Kubernetes for scaling).
